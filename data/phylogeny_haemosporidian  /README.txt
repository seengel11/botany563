super_alignments.zip: Fasta files containing the concatenated multigene aignments of the datasets listed in Supplemental Table S4.
single_gene_aa.zip: Fasta files containing the single amino acid nucleotide alignments of the 21 nuclear genes. The alignments were created using MAFFT L-INS-i v7.013.
single_gene_aa_gblocks.zip: Fasta files containing the single gene amino acid alignments of the 21 nuclear genes after processing by Gblocks 0.91b (allowing for smaller final blocks, gap positions within the final blocks, and less strict flanking positions).
single_gene_codons.zip: Fasta files containing the single gene nucleotide alignments of the 21 nuclear genes. The nucleotide (codon) alignments are based on the amino acid alignments.
single_gene_codons_gblocks.zip: Fasta files containing the single gene nucleotide alignments of the 21 nuclear genes after processing by Gblocks. The nucleotide (codon) alignments are based on the Gblocks processed amino acid alignments.
single_gene_martinsen_schaer_borner_combined.zip: Fasta files containing the single gene nucleotide alignments comprising data for five genes from the studies of Martinsen et al. (2008), Schaer et al. (2013) and Borner et al. (2015).
