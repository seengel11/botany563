## Data 

Pheuticus is a genus of New World song birds also known as cardinals. Theses bird species are found across north, central, and south america. They are characterized by their complex songs, strong and large bills, and bright pigmentations. My data set contains information 22 Pheucticus samples and a single outgroup taxon. Sequenced are 9 loci (See table).

The data was downloaded from the paperd Dryad repository:

### Quality Control
Aliments were conducted using Sequencher v4.9. Indelligent was used to resolve insertion/deletion events in introns in homologous nuclear alleles. They used the software PHASE v1.2 to infer the most likely arrangement of alleles at heterozygous sites in nuclear introns. Ambigious were labeled where a posterior probability was <0.90. Finally, They tested for recombination using RDP3. They constructed Gene Trees using MrBayes v3.1.2. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), as implemented in MrModeltest v2.2, was used to select the best model of nucleotide substitution for each locus.
